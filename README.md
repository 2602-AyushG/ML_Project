# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Model
# Overview
This project involves the development of a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) model using various machine learning algorithms. The model is designed to classify different human activities based on sensor data, such as data collected from accelerometers and gyroscopes.<br>

# Features
Accurate Activity Classification: The model can classify multiple human activities such as walking, running, sitting, standing, etc.<br>
Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilizes a range of algorithms including Decision Trees, Random Forests.<br>
Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes data preprocessing steps like feature extraction, and feature selection.<br>
Evaluation Metrics: Provides detailed evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>

# Dataset
The model is trained and tested on a publicly available dataset, which includes sensor data collected from wearable devices.
